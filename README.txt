Intelligent Scissor Implementation

Created By:

Description: 
This is an implementation of an optimal scissor algorithm for segmenting at object boundaries described in: 

	E. N. Mortensen and W. A. Barrett,
	    “Intelligent Scissors for Image Composition,”
	    in ACM Computer Graphics (SIGGRAPH `95),
	    pp. 191-198, 1995

Required Software:
Matlab

Getting Started:
1. Open and run intelligent_scissor.m in matlab
2. An image will appear. Click to place a start point. Click again to place an end point.
3. After placing the end point, the two points will appear on the image and the live-wire will snap to an object boundary.
4. For best results clear all variables before running the program again.
